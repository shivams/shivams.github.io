In 2012, troubled with our bicycles gradually leaking air from their tires, we built a tire inflation system for our bicycles. In doing so, we literally re-invented the wheel! That is, we designed a new bicycle hub (*the central part of the wheel*). Several other designs were proposed, but only one could survive the tight budget constraints. The [project was awarded](http://www.iitk.ac.in/doaaold/convocation2013/medal2013.pdf) the best undergraduate project in the department as well as the institute (IIT Kanpur). Here is a demo of the design:

While doing the project, I got interested in the dynamics of bicycles. I discovered that why the bicycles remain stable was only recently understood. [Prof. Arend Schwab gave a talk on this topic in the same year (2012)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y4mbT3ozcA). Motivated with this, I went on to pursue a research degree in rigid body dynamics in 2013.
