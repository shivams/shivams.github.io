In 2012, troubled with our bicycles gradually leaking air from their tires, we built an automatic tire inflation system for our bicycles. In doing so, we literally re-invented the wheel! That is, we designed a new bicycle hub (*the central part of the wheel*). Several other designs were proposed, but only one could survive the tight budget constraints. The [project was awarded](http://www.iitk.ac.in/doaaold/convocation2013/medal2013.pdf) the best undergraduate project in the department as well as the institute (IIT Kanpur). Here is a demo of the design:

While doing the project, I got interested in the dynamics of bicycles. I discovered that why the bicycles remain balanced was only recently understood. [Prof. Arend Schwab gave a talk on this topic in the same year (2012)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y4mbT3ozcA). This was shocking to me. Bicycle balancing is studied under the framework of ideal rigid bodies. And the theory of rigid bodies is a complete, "*a-priori*" framework. That is, once you have the laws of Classical Mechanics, you don't need to go "out" anywhere to find answers; all answers are available within your pen-and-paper analysis (given that you can solve the equations somehow). 

Motivated with this, I went on to pursue a research degree in rigid body dynamics in 2013. And in my dissertation, I tested the limits of this "a-priori" framework. *How much could we do simply using rigid-body assumptions, and without considering the bodies as flexible?* See [my thesis work here](/publication/2019-12-06-reaction-solvability-natural-inacommm).
