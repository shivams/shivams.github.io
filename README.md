This is Shivam.

I am interested in Machines: things which can do stuff like manipulation in space and computation. I am also interested in how they communicate.

I believe that theory and practice should go together.

And I think languages are a test-bed for a whole lot of discovery that lies ahead. Yes, languages can provide us insight into human nature. But I believe that language can provide us insight into the universe.
