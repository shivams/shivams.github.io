I am the technical advisor and former CTO of an Indian environmental monitoring startup, [Kritsnam Technologies](http://www.kritsnam.in). This startup provides end-to-end solutions for hydrological monitoring needs; developing the hardware, firmware, software and even deployment! Yes, I personally went hiking for installing instruments in the Himalayas.

Previously, I worked as an Embedded Engineer in Applied Electronics, the oldest inverter manufacturing company in Northern India (founded by my father). My work in the past 5 years in both these companies has been related to Internet of Things. It started in 2016 with me attempting to do a 10-km long WiFi transmission to monitor some solar inverters. I joined Kritsnam in 2017, where I worked on LoRa and other longer-range technologies. The IoT devices that I have programmed in these 5 years have been deployed across India and Bangladesh. We have filed a patent for a novel IoT circuit in Kritsnam. We hope this device would one day leave the Indian sub-continent.

### Interests

I am interested in Machines: both mechanical and computational. I am also interested in how they communicate.

And I think natural languages are a test-bed for a whole lot of discovery that lies ahead. And not just the human mind, but also the mysteries of the universe.

Finally, I believe that theory and practice should go together.
