I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science, Texas A&M University, working in the "*Programming Languages and Verification*" area, with the awesome [O2Lab](https://o2lab.github.io/) people.

Previously, I was the CTO of an Indian environmental monitoring startup, [Kritsnam Technologies](http://www.kritsnam.in). This startup provides end-to-end solutions for environmental (hydrological) monitoring needs: hardware, firmware, software and even deployment! Yes, I personally went hiking for installing instruments in the Himalayas.

Before that, I worked as an Embedded Engineer in *Applied Electronics*, one of the oldest inverter manufacturing companies in Northern India (founded by my father). My work in the past 5 years (~2015 to 2020) in both these companies has been related to Internet of Things. It started in 2016 with me attempting to do a 10-km long WiFi transmission to monitor some solar inverters. I joined Kritsnam in 2017, where I worked on LoRa and other longer-range technologies. The IoT devices that I have programmed in these 5 years have been deployed across India and Bangladesh. We have filed a patent for a novel IoT circuit in Kritsnam. We hope this device would one day leave the Indian sub-continent.

### Interests

I am interested in Machines: both mechanical and computational. I am interested in how they communicate with each other and to humans. I am also interested in the organization of knowledge and how we can build a zero-entropy system for our knowledge consumption and creation needs (as finite human beings). I am also interested in music composition but I haven't composed anything for many years now. I am trying to rejuvenate my lost interest in music this year (in 2021!).

Previously, I have been interested in the dynamics of bicycles. [See this project](/projects/2012-tire-inflation-bicycle/) which motivated me to pursue a research degree in rigid body dynamics.
