I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, Texas A&M University (TAMU). My research area is in Computational Geometry, especially in the more theoretical side of it. 
During the first COVID wave, I discovered how the whole of development of Mathematics (from ancient Greeks to modern mathematics) has been motivated by Geometry.
I was planning to organize a workshop in Geometry, however soon the second wave hit.
It amazes me to know that I am finally doing PhD in this amazing field!

Before joining TAMU, I was working in an Indian environmental monitoring startup, [Kritsnam Technologies](http://www.kritsnam.in). This startup provides end-to-end solutions for environmental (hydrological) monitoring needs: hardware, firmware, software and even deployment! Yes, I personally went hiking for installing instruments in the Himalayas.
Before that, I worked as an Embedded Engineer in *Applied Electronics*, one of the oldest inverter manufacturing companies in Northern India. My work in those 5 years (~2015 to 2020) in both these companies has been related to *Internet of Things (IoT)*. 
The IoT devices that we built have been deployed across India and Bangladesh. We hope these devices would one day leave the Indian sub-continent.
<!-- It started in 2016 with me attempting to do a 10-km long WiFi transmission to monitor some solar inverters. I joined Kritsnam in 2016, where I worked on LoRa and other longer-range technologies.  -->

### Interests

I am interested in Machines: both mechanical and computational. I am interested in how they communicate with each other and to humans. I am also interested in the organization of knowledge and how we can build a zero-entropy system for our knowledge consumption and creation needs (as finite human beings). I am also interested in music composition but I haven't composed anything for many years now. I am trying to rejuvenate my lost interest in music this year (in 2021!).

Previously, I have been interested in the dynamics of bicycles. [See this project](/projects/2012-tire-inflation-bicycle/) which motivated me to pursue a research degree in rigid body dynamics.
