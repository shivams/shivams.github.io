Hi. This is Shivam.

I am interested in Machines: both mechanical and computational. I am also interested in how they communicate.

And I think natural languages are a test-bed for a whole lot of discovery that lies ahead. And not just the human mind, but also the mysteries of the universe.

Finally, I believe that theory and practice should go together.
